## Preparation

Almond biscuit

1. In a bowl or stand mixer, mix the whole eggs with the sugar. Add the almond powder, rum and melted butter. Place in a cake mold of about 18 cm. Bake for 20 minutes in a thermostat 6 oven (180 Â° C).
2. After cooking, let the fondant cool in the mold and unmold it when cold, passing a knife along the circle.
3. Arrange the fondant on a serving dish and place the adjustable cake ring around it, slightly reducing the diameter to prevent the Bavarian cream from leaking out.

Bavarian cream

1. Defrost the raspberries. Mix them then pass them through a Chinese to remove the seeds.
2. Soak the gelatin in cold water.
3. Heat the raspberry puree in a saucepan with the sugar. Add softened gelatin. Mix so that it melts well and let cool.
4. Beat the whole cream into a firm whipped cream (remember to put the whisk and the salad bowl in the fridge 1 hour before and the whole cream in the frizer 10 minutes before). Add the icing sugar and whisk again.
5. Using a spatula, gently mix the cooled raspberry puree with the Chantilly cream.
6. Spread this mixture over the almond fondant in the mousse ring. Put aside in the fridge for at least 2 hours.

Mirror Glaze

1. After 2 hours, prepare the mirror glase. Soften the gelatin in cold water.
2. Mix the strawberries and pass them through the Chinese.
3. In a saucepan, heat the strawberry coulis and sugar.
4. Off the heat, add the softened gelatin and mix well until it melt.
5. Let cool and spread evenly over the raspberry bavarois. Place back in the fridge for at least 2 hours. For my part, I left it all night.
6. Carefully remove the circle and decorate as you want
